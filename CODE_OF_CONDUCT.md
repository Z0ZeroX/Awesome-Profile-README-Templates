Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### 📞 Reporting Guidelines

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement by opening an issue in this repository's Issues tab: [Issues](https://github.com/Z0ZeroX/Awesome-Github-Profile-README-Templates/issues).

When reporting, please include:
- **What happened** - A clear description of the incident
- **When it happened** - Date and time if possible
- **Where it happened** - Link to the specific issue, PR, or discussion
- **Who was involved** - Usernames of people involved
- **Any evidence** - Screenshots, links, or other documentation

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### 🔒 Privacy Protection

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. We will:
- Keep reports confidential
- Only share information on a need-to-know basis
- Protect the identity of reporters
- Provide updates on the investigation process
